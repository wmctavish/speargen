# speargen
Targeted passoword dictionary generator based on user-supplied keywords 

SpearGen was created to generate targeted password dictionaries which recursively attach & combine every possible number 
from 1-9999, make common character swaps ('a' for '@', 's' for '$', etc), and capitalizes every entry, all while
leaving original keywords in place as well.

***NOTE***
Generated dictionaries can be fairly large - even a couple given keywords will generate a .txt file of 13-15MB
